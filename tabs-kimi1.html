        <p>
Arranging this was definitely a change of pace for me. It was challenging to arrange in a way that was completely different than ever before, and there are two reasons why: <br><br>
1. The songs I arranged in this medley are background tracks. This means that they're usually repetitive if played fully (and I'm in no way saying that's a bad thing. It's just that in this situation it's not preferred). And so, I had to carefully compress the songs without them totally losing their touch, which is something I've rarely had to do. <br>
2. This is the first medley I've ever arranged! YAY! Well, it's only two songs meshed together, but it's still a medley! It was interesting to mess around and figure out how many climaxes I want, if I wanted any changes in pace, tone, etc. For this particular medley, I kept it simple and made the two songs have a very similar atmosphere. The use of the loop pedal at the end I felt was necessary in order to make the medley feel complete; without it, there would be no climax. <br><br></p>
