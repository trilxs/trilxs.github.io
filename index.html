            <p><b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</b><br/>
                It was definitely a lot harder than the other assignments. The hardest part would have to be adding the note and creating the dismiss button for it.<br/><br/>
                <b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b><br/>
                I learned how to use arrays and take care of multiple buttons at the same time with one or two lines of code.<br/><br/>
                <b>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</b><br/>
                Piazza was really useful. I also googled many many things, and luckily, they were all problems people have had before.<br/><br/>
                <b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b><br/>
                1. "css not applying javascript innerhtml"<br/>
                2. "use strict"<br/><br/></p>
